Today I tried The 'Baby Names exercise' in the google online tutorials.

It's basically about the 'Regular Expression' part in python.

So I'd to revise that part..

I learned the usage of Regular Expressions..

Problem was slightly difficult, and I made some modifications in the problem.

At some places I'd to look at the solution part, but still I did the major logic of the problem.

I also completed the wordcount problem, which was not finished yesterday
