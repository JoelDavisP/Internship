Class reached to the second week..

Started google online tutorial classes yesterday..

Read 4 lessons.

Attended class in the morning batch..

Studied about list comprehension, generator object and generator expression and also yield command..

Studied a basic application of yield command, i.e. using in large data traversal scenarios..

Yield is useful because it only stores small amount of data at a time, not the entire data..

studied xrange and range command..

Tried to modify python source code, but that attempt was not succeeded..
