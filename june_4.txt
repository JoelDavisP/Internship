Another good day. 

Started studying tutorials.

Before that lesrned how to mount in linux.

Then mounted the given tutorials to home. 

Started watching and learning it one by one.

Completed the first two tutorials (Vim and Commandline tuts).

Starting was easy.

Then started watching third one commands.

Seems to be tough one, little bored.

Then continued after a while and finished the first 3 videos.


Now commiting...
