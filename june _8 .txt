Nothing new today..

I's just revising the previous sessions.

So many new things started in this month and thus so much to do for my brain..

I thought it'll be better to revise those stuffs studied until now.

Just read all the notes prepared and refreshed mind.

Revised python tutorials and git..

Thats all for the day and waiting for the upcoming sessions!!!
